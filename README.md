This toolboard uses a 16 pin Microfit 3.0 connector and provides XH connections at the toolhead for:
* Extruder
* Hot End (Microfit 3.0 or XH)
* Thermistor
* Hot End Fan (12/24V selectable)
* Part Cooling Fan x2 (12/24V selectable)
* Switch - for endstop or other use
* Aux - 3 more connections for BLTouch or other use
* LED - Always on (12/24V selectable via trace cut/jump).  This may be used as a generic power source.

# BOM  
* 1x PCB (See Below)
* 1 16 pin Microfit3 board connector.  Right angle or upright.
* 1 2 pin Microfit3 upright board connector.
* 2x 4 pin XH connectors
* 5x 2 pin XH connectors
* 2x 3 pin jumper headers (optional, may solder jumper instead)
* 2x 2 pin jumpers (optional, may solder jumper instead)
* 1x 16 pin Microfit cable connector, or [prewired 16 pin microfit cable harness](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4001132970645.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.27424c4d12p2WJ) (recommended)

# PCB Manufacturing
I recommend [JLCPB](http://https://jlcpcb.com/) for getting the boards made inexpensively and efficiently.
[OshPark](https://oshpark.com/) is another option.
You only need to upload the gerbers zip file.
